2. Identify overall trends in marketing campaigns.
3. Analyze user behavior (in particular time spent) on our website across different weekdays and campaigns.

## Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- **Session Definition:** Sessions were defined based on user actions with inactivity intervals not exceeding 30 minutes.
- **Session Classification:** Sessions were categorized into No Marketing, Marketing, and Mixed Sessions.
